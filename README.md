This repository provides the latest C++ implementation of the branch-and-cut framework and the valid inequalities that we used to write "Asymmetric multi-depot vehicle routing problems: valid inequalities and a branch-and-cut algorithm".
The exact version as used while writing the manuscript can be found as an online suplement to the publication (doi url here). 

--  The code will be made available immediately once the manuscript is accepted --
